WIP

When completed, this project will allow you to input a book (.epub, anything with no DRM), and receive in return a list of it's most uncommon words, in order.
The purpose is so people like me who prefer paper books, can read smoothly without needing to pause and look up words they dont know, thus enjoy a better reading experience.
